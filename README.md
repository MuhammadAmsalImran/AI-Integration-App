# AI-Integration-App
This repository contains the full implementation of Projex AI, a collaborative project-planning application developed for CS1200 (Assignment 3). The app allows users to upload project guidelines, deadlines, and group members’ skills so the AI can generate a timeline, divide the workload, and return a concise 200-word plan.
